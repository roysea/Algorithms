It thinks the best path to [3,1] is by going west from [4,1]. If A* had time to explore more, it'd find a better path to [3,1] is by going north from [3,2], with a cost_so_far of 14. You can trigger this by blocking the shortest path and you'll see the costs drop.","isAtFlagLimit":false,"isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"forum":"redblobgames","depth":1,"points":9,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2014-07-22T14:10:38","dislikes":0,"thread":"2839183204","numReports":0,"likes":3,"message":"\u003cp>this is awesome !

 a lot for your information, Amit! As I understand, you have implemented
 all the magic on the client side. Just wondering if you have considered
 to implement some on the server side, e.g. the algorithms, and then 
communicating with (e.g. passing the solution path to) the client side

 It means I need a more complicated server, and have to deal with load 
spikes such as when the page is posted on reddit or hackernews and I get
 50k hits all at once. Right now I have one "micro" amazon instance that
 serves static html, and it can handle all the traffic. With static html
 I also have the flexibility of using s3 or some other system. Static 
html can also be archived and cached; it's less fragile.</p><p>(2). 
There's some latency for calculating results and getting them back. 
Unless I have servers all over the world, some users may have a latency 
of 300ms or more. That means as you drag the slider, I could not make a 
smooth animation of the recalculation. Right now with client side 
calculations it can run in under 10ms, which allows for smooth 
animations.</p><p>It might seem like running the algorithms on the 
server would be useful if the algorithms were complicated, but because 
of problem (1), I would not be able to run the algorithms if there is a 
load spike! The total computing power in the browsers is larger than the
 total computing power on my servers. Running the algorithms on the 
server might be useful if the data is big, but so far these tutorials 
have small data. Maybe there will be a tutorial in the future where I 
need larger data.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>bobo, that's a <em>really good</em>
 question. It's something I didn't explain adequately. Both A* and 
Dijkstra's Algorithm can reduce the priority of a node as they explore 
and find better paths to the node. As long as a node is in the frontier,
 it can be updated with better priorities. In this case, A* hasn't found
 the best path to [3,1] (because it's efficient—it's not spending as 
much time exploring paths to things that don't matter), and its 
cost_so_far is 16. It thinks the best path to [3,1] is by going west 
from [4,1]. If A* had time to explore more, it'd find a better path to 
[3,1] is by going north from [3,2], with a cost_so_far of 14. You can

printing the cost_so_far value on the grid to see what it's doing, like 
in the <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redblobgames.com%2Fpathfinding%2Fa-star%2Fintroduction.html%23dijkstra%3A0b6wual02pKBYZqsJf-o6z919vg&amp;cuid=1242851" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#dijkstra">"Movement costs" section of this page</a>.
 If your movement costs are all 1, then each step should increase by 1. 
If you're finding any adjacent tile where the cost_so_far increased by 
more than 1, there's a bug in your code.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

make these areas into nodes, but how would I go about doing this? I 
would also greatly appreciate it if you explained this to me in C#, as

 be a good idea or a waste of resources useless?<br>(Anyway, I realize that there would still be no combinations to connect one room to another in this case)</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li id="comment__share-4639120455" class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" href="#" data-action="expand-share"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter" aria-label="Share comment on Twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook" aria-label="Share comment on Facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/24q0g93" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link to comment"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/24q0g93"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:4639120455"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div class="moderate-form blacklist-form" data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div class="moderate-form flag-form" data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="badges-form" data-role="badges-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-4649740096"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="4649740096"><li class="post-menu-item collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="post-menu-item expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class=" post-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="291158" src="a_data_002/avatar92_004.jpg" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amitp</a></span> <span class="badge moderator">Mod</span></span><span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-4639120455" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> vinnie</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-4649740096" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Saturday, October 12, 2019 8:05 AM">3 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I think the answer is <b>yes</b> there are ways to reuse some of the calculation.

 which works by adding one room at a time and then updating the shortest
 path tables. And there are several other approaches too. However I 
think the first thing to do is implement the simplest system and then 
measure its performance. It can be interesting but often not worth 
optimizing something that isn't using a lot of resources :)</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li id="comment__share-4649740096" class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" href="#" data-action="expand-share"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter" aria-label="Share comment on Twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook" aria-label="Share comment on Facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/24wc2f4" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link to comment"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/24wc2f4"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:4649740096"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div class="moderate-form blacklist-form" data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div class="moderate-form flag-form" data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="badges-form" data-role="badges-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-4650372107"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="4650372107"><li class="post-menu-item collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="post-menu-item expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class=" post-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/genopernotranslucente/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="genopernotranslucente" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="293465895" src="a_data_002/avatar92_004.jpg" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/genopernotranslucente/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="genopernotranslucente" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vinnie</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-4649740096" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> amitp</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-4650372107" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Saturday, October 12, 2019 9:08 PM">3 years ago</a> <span><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <span class="has-edit" data-role="has-edit">edited</span></span></span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Yes,
 it is almost totally sure that I would not get benefits due to the 
small size of my map, although the addition of one room at a time would 
perhaps be the ideal situation for storing coordinates, I think that I 
will follow your advice and I will postpone the optimization later, if I
 feel like it.<br>In the meantime I've implemented your algorithms (with
 some changes because of the different data structures) and I've done 
some performance tests, I'll pass them to you just for the record, the 
times you see are the sum of 10 repetitions.<br>In one you see how much better A* is, in the other in a particular case you see that readth works better!<br><a

 is your opinion on how the A* algorithm is affected when dealing with 
parties/stacks of units pathfinding together? wherein they may have 
varying 'MaxMovement' per turn, and may also expend movement through 
terrain different to eachother (some units may be able to walk quickly 
through forest, however others may be subjected to a penalty)</p><p>This
 has been the fun challenge that I have been trying to get my head 
around recently, yet have not seen it covered by anybody discussing grid
 based/turnbased pathfinding (despite game such as Age of Wonders having
 this as an integral part of their pathfinding).</p><p>My main approach 
so far is setting the frontier cells to have a priority value based on 
the unit with the lowest amount of movement left, and then having the 
priority queue of the frontier sorting to have the cell with the highest
 'minMovement' of left. I believe this breaks down when the pathfinding 
continues beyond a unit's per-turn movement speed though so I think I 
have to have each cell store every unit's remaining movement, as well as
 its 'turns used', so the priority queue is further sorted to have the 
cells with the lowest turn value at the front, with cells of the same 
turn value being sorted by the 'minMovement'.</p><p>I assume I'll figure
 it out eventually, however it's very interesting that it's seldom 
talked about as a form of pathfinding constraints.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-1" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">1</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-1" data-action="downvote" title="" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">1</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li id="comment__share-5154434910" class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" href="#" data-action="expand-share"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter" aria-label="Share comment on Twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook" aria-label="Share comment on Facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/2d8tffi" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link to comment"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/2d8tffi"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:5154434910"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div class="moderate-form blacklist-form" data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div class="moderate-form flag-form" data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="badges-form" data-role="badges-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-5156488506"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="5156488506"><li class="post-menu-item collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="post-menu-item expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class=" post-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="291158" src="a_data_002/avatar92_004.jpg" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amitp</a></span> <span class="badge moderator">Mod</span></span><span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5154434910" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Ethan Allen</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5156488506" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Wednesday, November 18, 2020 9:07 AM">2 years ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I
 think that's where the usual A* tutorials break down — A* is only one 
piece of the puzzle and there can be *lots* of different approaches 
layered on top. A pure A* idea might be to generalize from location 
nodes to <i>state</i> nodes. Then you have a graph of states, where the 
state would include x, y, and remaining movement for each unit. This 
leads to a lot more nodes, but it'd give you more precise paths. Another
 idea would be to have A* explore a graph of movements you can make in 
one turn, so A* would see one node per turn. Then you'd construct the 
nodes (in the neighbors function) to be all possible movements you can 
make this turn, taking into account movement cost and maxmovement. You 
could do this step with BFS or Dijkstra's. But this too might lead to a 
large number of nodes. I expect that in practice most games give up on 
optimal paths and instead settle for reasonable paths using some 
game-specific logic to decide how to move combined with A* for the 
overall pathfinding.</p><p>I agree, it's seldom talked about, but I

 : how could I do a breadth- first search with a limited move range ? My
 use case is this : I'm making a tactical game and my units move on a 
grid. They have some move points, and can't travel more cells than they 
have move points. If there's an obstacle they have to avoid it. When I 
have a start point and an end point, I use A*, but say I want to display
 every cell that my unit can go to ? Your breadth-first search anim is 
pretty much exactly what I want, problem is, it keeps searching for 
cells regardless of "range" or "cycles" and the "goal reached" showcase 
isn't what I'm trying to do at all.</p><p>I managed to make this feature
 by iterating over every cell in my range instead of searching for them,
 and checking if the A* leading to said cell is less or equal than my 
move range. It works, but I'm afraid it's too inefficient in cases where
 my grid is really big.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li id="comment__share-5963262321" class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" href="#" data-action="expand-share"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter" aria-label="Share comment on Twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook" aria-label="Share comment on Facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/2qmdenl" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link to comment"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/2qmdenl"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:5963262321"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div class="moderate-form blacklist-form" data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div class="moderate-form flag-form" data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="badges-form" data-role="badges-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-5963782104"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="5963782104"><li class="post-menu-item collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="post-menu-item expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class=" post-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="291158" src="a_data_002/avatar92_004.jpg" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/amitp/" data-action="profile" data-tab="" data-username="amitp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amitp</a></span> <span class="badge moderator">Mod</span></span><span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5963262321" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Pheo</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5963782104" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Monday, August 29, 2022 12:56 PM">2 months ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Thanks!
 Yes, you can do a breadth-first search with a custom "early exit". For 
normal pathfinding we do early exit when we find the destination node. 
But what you want instead is to stop searching when you reach some 
"range".</p><p>There are two things we could track in BFS. One is the 
"parent" pointer, used for reconstructing paths. The other is the 
distance, which is what you want here. If you want all cells up to 
distance 4 then when you are adding neighbors to the queue, do not add 
any neighbors that have distance greater than 4. That way the queue will
 contain *only* the nodes distance 4 or less.</p><p>Then you will not have to run A* to check distances, and it will run very very fast.</p><p>I have a demo of this here: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redblobgames.com%2Fgrids%2Fhexagons%2F%23range-obstacles%3AxIhwgNheNzYWjOmldZrBN8ONwC8&amp;cuid=1242851" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#range-obstacles">https://www.redblobgames.co...</a> . It is essentially the same as the BFS algorithm but written slightly differently.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div class="post-votes"><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a><div class="post-votes__separator"></div><a href="#" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span> <span class="updatable count" data-role="dislikes">0</span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a class="comment-footer__action" href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li id="comment__share-5963782104" class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" href="#" data-action="expand-share"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><div class="comment-share__social-share-buttons"><li class="twitter share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-twitter" data-action="share:twitter" aria-label="Share comment on Twitter"></button></li><li class="facebook share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-facebook" data-action="share:facebook" aria-label="Share comment on Facebook"></button></li></div><li class="link share__button-container"><button class="share__button icon icon-link" value="http://disq.us/p/2qmojq0" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link to comment"></button><input class="share__button link_url" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/2qmojq0"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:5963782104"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div class="moderate-form blacklist-form" data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div class="moderate-form flag-form" data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="badges-form" data-role="badges-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-5965186394"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="5965186394"><li class="post-menu-item collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="post-menu-item expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class=" post-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar"><div class="user"><img src="a_data_002/avatar92_004.jpg" class="user" alt="Avatar"></div></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span class="author">Pheo</span><span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5963782104" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> amitp</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#comment-5965186394" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Tuesday, August 30, 2022 11:39 PM">2 months ago</a> </span>  </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>holy cow you're a wizard, it works !
