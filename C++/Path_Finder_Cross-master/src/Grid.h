/*
	The grid class is designed to store a 2 dimensional vector of Node objects.
	It's member variables include the width and height of the window, the width
	and height of the grid, a pointer to the current window, and the 2D vector
	of Node objects.

	1)
	A Grid object should be constructed with a pointer to the window where the grid
	should be drawn on and the width and the height of the desired grid. The 2d
	vector of Nodes must first be constructed by resizing the vector to the desired
	width and height. Then, using the "init_grid()" function will fill the 2d vector with
	Node objects. Lastly, the "update_grid_layout()" function should be called to set the
	size and position of each of the Node objects.

	2)
	The resize(int width, int height) should be used to change the size of the grid whenever
	the user desires. It should retain information about the grid before and after the function
	is called. For example, if there is a Node with a NodeState == wall and it's position is 
	(10, 10) on the graph, when the grid is resized from being 14x14 to 20x20, that Node should
	still be (10, 10) on the grid after the resize.

	3)
	The update_grid_layout() function is in charge of resizing and handling the positions for
	each Node::Rectangle on the grid. the grid only needs to be updated when changes are made
	to it. Updating the grid every render cycle will slow down the program so stray away from
	doing multiple calls of the function consecutively if you don't need to.

	4)
	The draw_grid() function draws each Node in the grid onto the Window
